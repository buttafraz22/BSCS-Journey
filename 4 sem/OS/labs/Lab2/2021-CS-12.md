# Linux Commands

In Linux, the terminal is a powerful tool for day-to-day tasks. Unlike in windows, where the equivalent cmd prompt/ powershell is an abstract level representation of the kernel, the linux terminal actually allows to configure and run the operating system. It is also one of the main reasons why linux is so secure. Because in linux, we can actually configure the security access of *each file* as contrasted to the whole bash at once.

## Lab Task 1: Linux Prompt Commands with Mr. Tom

a) “touch 19f-XXXX.txt” will be the command in this case.

b) "touch tom.txt" will be the command in this case.

c) "cat 19f-XXX.txt >> tom.txt" 

d) grep "roll no." and path copied from pwd

e) chmod 577

f) "pwd" gives the location of the present working directory.

g) mkdir personal

h) echo "thank you"

## Lab Task 2: Various permissions

1) touch “19f-XXXX_OS-lab_rules.txt”

2) The read has number 4. Write has 2, execute has 1. For (- rwx r-x r--) this permission settings, we will have to insert the command "chmod 754 19f-XXXX_OS-lab_rules.txt" to set this permission.
